# Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:
#
# Mat size must be MxN. (N is an odd natural number, and M is 3 times N)
# The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.
# The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.

N, M = map(int, input().split()) 
for i in range(1, N, 2): 
    print((i*".|.").center(M, '-'))
print('WELCOME'.center(M, '-'))
for i in range(N-2, -1, -2): 
    print((i*".|.").center(M, '-'))
